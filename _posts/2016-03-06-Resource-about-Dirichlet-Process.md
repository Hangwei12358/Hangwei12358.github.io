A very good video tutorial on Dirichlet Process (DP) and Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP) (click <a href="http://videolectures.net/mlss07_teh_dp/" target = "_blank">here</a>).
By the way, the <a href="http://videolectures.net/" target ="_blank">Videolectures.net website</a> is really useful for PhDs and researchers.
 
Will keep updating.

I like this journey~~
