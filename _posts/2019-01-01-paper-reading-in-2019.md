### Class Imbalance Problem in Deep Learning
- **Neural Networks 2018** A systematic study of the class imbalance problem in convolutional neural networks
    - this paper systematically compares several classical methods used to solve class imbalance problem
    - Methods for addressing imbalance:
        - data level methods (oversampling, undersampling)
        - classifier level methods (weighted classifier, thresholding with prior class probabilities)
