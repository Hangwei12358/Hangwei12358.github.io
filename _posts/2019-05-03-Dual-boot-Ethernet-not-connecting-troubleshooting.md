One possible problem encountered during the installment of dual boot systems (Ubuntu and Windows) is the connection problem of Ethernet network.   

It occurs after system updates of either one of the systems, and I find that the most probable problem may be the BIOS setting on **Wake on LAN/WLAN**.   

This feature should be set to `LAN or WLAN` instead of the default setting `DISABLED`, as shown in the following figure.
