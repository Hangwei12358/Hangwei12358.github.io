ï»¿Summary of transfer-based papers in AAAI'18

May. 16. 2018, by Hangwei

-----------------------------------------------------

### Tips
> many of the accepted papers do not choose keywords 'transfer learning'
> the category of the paper does not all match the keywords chosen during submission.
### Summary
In total, there are 20 papers that contain 'transfer' in title in accepted papers of AAAI'18. There does not exist papers on transfer-based Human Activity Recognition, therefore it's possible and promise to conduct such a paper for AAAI'19.

### Summary Table
