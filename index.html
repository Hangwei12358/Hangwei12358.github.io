	<p>Hi there, I am QIAN Hangwei (钱航薇). Currently I am a research scientist working with <a href= "https://www.a-star.edu.sg/cfar/about-cfar/management/prof-ivor-tsang" target="_blank">Prof Ivor Tsang</a> at Centre for Frontier AI Research (CFAR), A*STAR, Singapore.  <!-- My research interests are unsupervised learning, transfer learning, kernel methods, and wearable-based studies. p class="lead" -->

	<p> Previously I was a Wallenberg - NTU Presidential Postdoctoral Fellow (PPF). I spent my second year of PPF in Lund University, Sweden working with Prof Kalle Åström, and my first year in Nanyang Technological University, Singapore with Prof Chunyan Miao. </p>


    
    <p>I obtained my Ph.D. in School of Computer Science and Engineering at NTU, Singapore in 2020. I'm honored to be advised by <a href= "https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~sinnopan/" target="_blank">Prof Sinno Jialin Pan</a>. I received my B.E. from Automation, School of Information Science and Technology from<a href="http://en.ustc.edu.cn/" target = "_blank"> Univeristy of Science and Technology of China (USTC)</a> in 2015.</p>
